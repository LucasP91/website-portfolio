/* ============================================================================
 *  SITE CONTENT  —  ALL website text lives here. Edit this file to rewrite copy.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 *  HOW TO EDIT (safe rules):
 *  • Only change the words *between the backticks* ` ... `.
 *      e.g.  title: `I build the things I'm told can't be built.`
 *                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ change this, keep the backticks ^^^^^^^^^^^^
 *  • Backticks let you type apostrophes (') and quotes (") freely — no escaping.
 *  • Keep the commas, the [ ] brackets, and the { } braces as they are.
 *  • To add a bullet/tag/item, copy an existing line (with its quotes + comma)
 *    and edit it. To remove one, delete the whole line.
 *  • Don't rename the labels on the left (title:, heading:, etc.).

I've chased that feeling since I rebalanced a Lego Technic motorcycle everyone said couldn't stand on its own, and since my uncle — a mechanical engineer in Germany — taught me to solder over Skype and shipped me a rough little 3D printer at eleven. I've been designing and building real hardware ever since.`,
      `Today I'm a mechanical engineering student at WPI on a combined B.S./M.S. in Mechanical Engineering, with a second B.S. major in Robotics Engineering — all in four years. I design and build robotic systems, embedded electronics, and CAD assemblies, and I direct AI to write the software and automation around them. I'm an engineering intern at Microboard Processing, and a dual US/German citizen, bilingual in English and German. Long-term, I want to point that same problem-solving at eco-friendly, high-performance vehicles.`,
